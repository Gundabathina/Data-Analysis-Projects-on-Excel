# Dashboard Creation
An interactive and visually appealing dashboard was created to consolidate key metrics and trends. The dashboard includes:

- Total Sales Over Time: Line chart displaying sales trends for different coffee types (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, Robusta) over the specified period.
- Sales by Country: Bar chart highlighting total sales in the United States, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.
- Top 5 Customers: Bar chart identifying the top five customers based on their total purchases.
## Interactive Elements
